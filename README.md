### Introduction

This is a library with _essentials_ for Swift programmers. Although primarily motivated by my work on apps for the Apple platforms, it should run on all platforms where the Swift Package Manager is available.

### History & Status

This is pretty much an early work-in-progress. With a decade of Objective-C experience and a solid bunch of such frameworks, I have only recently started developing with Swift.
Rather than blindly rewriting everything, I'm going to add stuff on-demand when I need it in my projects.
